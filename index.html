            <p>Eating healthy is of utmost importance as it directly impacts our
                overall well-being and quality of life. A balanced and nutritious diet
                provides essential nutrients, vitamins, and minerals that support our
                body's functions, boost the immune system, and help prevent various
                chronic illnesses. A healthy diet can also aid in maintaining a healthy
                weight, reducing the risk of obesity-related conditions, and promoting
                cardiovascular health. Additionally, good nutrition contributes to better
                mental clarity and emotional stability, enhancing cognitive function and
                promoting a positive outlook on life. By making conscious choices to eat
                healthily, we invest in our long-term health and vitality, enabling us to
                lead active, fulfilling lives and enjoy each day to the fullest.</p>

            <p>Nutritional facts, often found on food labels or packaging,
                provide vital information about the composition of a food product
                and its impact on our health. These facts include details such as
                serving size, calories, macro nutrients (such as carbohydrates, fats,
                and proteins), micro nutrients (such as vitamins and minerals), and other
                important components like fiber and sugar content. Understanding and
                paying attention to nutritional facts empower us to make informed food
                choices, tailor our diets to meet specific dietary needs or goals, and
                maintain a balanced and healthy lifestyle. Whether managing weight,
                controlling blood sugar levels, or addressing specific nutritional
                deficiencies, being aware of nutritional facts is crucial in promoting
                overall well-being and making conscious decisions about the foods we
                consume.</p>

                    <h1>Toussaint Gilbert </h1>
                    <p> Hello! My name is Toussaint. I'm an 18-year-old aspiring
                        computer scientist born on March 7th, 2005, in the vibrant city
                        of Chicago. Growing up in the dynamic neighborhood of Lincoln Park,
                        I was inspired by my mother, a strong businesswoman who owns a
                        successful salon in our community. Her determination and entrepreneurial
                        spirit have influenced my own pursuit of excellence. From an early age,
                        I developed a deep fascination with technology and the intricate
                        science behind computers. This passion has driven me to explore the
                        ever-evolving world of computer science. Currently, I am pursuing a
                        boot camp course at Northwestern University, where I am acquiring the
                        foundational knowledge and practical skills necessary for success in this
                        field.</p>
